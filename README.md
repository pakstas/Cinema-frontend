## Technologies 
I used primary `html`, `css`, `react-js`.
Under the hood I had to use `styled-components`, `jwt-decode`, `react hooks and contexts`, `responsive design` techniques.

This web app is connected with backend `Node.js` server and `MariaDB`. You can check the code of it on [github](https://github.com/pakstas/Cinema-backend).


## Setup 
- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`


## Status 
Cinema App is only a showcase and it can only be a beginning of a bigger project.
